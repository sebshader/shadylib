plans

This is a pure data library that I always add to whenever I want to either
do something myself or make something that hasn't been made in pd. Planned 
additions as of this writing are: a buzz~ that does not pop, bandlimited wavetables
 (as an external), dynamic inlet types for more oscillators and maybe a system to 
implement them, musical structure abstractions, an abstraction to join the endpoints 
of a table at the same sample value in a nice way, some pure data type foolery like 
encoding a float as an int for the purpose of more index precision for arrays, an 
external to get information about pd (like if it's running 32 or 64 bit). I may also want to change 
repeater into 2 seperate abstractions later, one for writing to the array and 
one for reading it. Finally, I would like to implement a state-saving system 
where states of abstractions are stored in files that are in the same directory 
as the root canvas. For awhile I was thinking of a system where it would use 
files in this directory if there were not a subpatch of a certain name within 
the root patch, where the abstraction could save data otherwise. sssad could be
used for this. For real finally, it might be interesting to make subpatches
have the same attributes as externals. the advantages would be use of arguments
while being able to keep them in the same contained patch. Changes to one could
be applied to many.  

to install just put this library in your search path and use [import shadelib]

... can't believe I didn't think of a better name
