to make & install: type "make install" in this (shadylib) directory

This is a pure data library

Many abstractions and externals are just ports and modifications of existing
programs, primarily patches from the pure data help files.

Some external libraries are needed, primarily zexy and iemlib, and cup/
cupd from ekext.
mrpeach, list-abs, and pdlua (for lmap) are also used

I would have liked to release everything under a BSD license but don't
think I can using externals that are licensed as GPL.
